The system uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract features from movie data, and then applies machine learning algorithms to build a recommendation model. The model recommends movies that are similar to the user's favorite movie, based on features such as genres, keywords, taglines, cast, and director."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"-Vbnt9CciKJP"},"source":["## **Data Source**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"sGcv5WqQiNyl"},"source":["The data used in the project is the MovieLens dataset, which can be obtained from the official website: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/.
